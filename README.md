Simple cpp 3d game engine (someday, maybe)

1. **LLVM/Clang Compiler**  
   - A modern, high-quality compiler toolchain.
   - Ensures we can compile our C++ project targeting the desired OpenGL environment.
   - To verify installation, run:
     ```bash
     clang --version
     ```
   - Make sure `clang` is in your PATH so it can be invoked from any terminal session.

2. **CMake**  
   - A cross-platform build system generator.
   - Allows us to write a single `CMakeLists.txt` configuration and generate build files for various systems and IDEs.
   - To verify installation, run:
     ```bash
     cmake --version
     ```
